        "text": "Air Kiss is an urban design speculation and poem about the experience of losing the borders\nof one’s body and mind to the city. The city outside is as (or more) sentient, complex, and irrational as the human self. The city is an urban scale personal mirror, a distributed alien self. Prediction, a core capability of neural networks, comes to fruition when synthetic systems collaborate for urban operations. Time becomes fuzzy when a cloud of predictions rises from the actions of millions of inhabitants in an address space of trillions of points."

It emulates the human, but in doing so, walks you through its dark, inverse uncanny valleys."
